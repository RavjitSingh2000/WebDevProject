            <h4>Deliveries: 45,000 and counting</h4>
            <p>While the 737 and A320 are the world's top passenger jetliners, the plucky little four-seater Cessna 172 is the most successful civil aircraft in history, with more than 45,000 of them reported to have been built.
            <br><br>
            Its primary use is as a training plane, and generation after generation of pilots have cut their teeth in them. The high wings on this single-engine craft give pilots better visibility, making it easier to get their bearings on the world around them and also to land.
            <br><br>
            The large cabin doors make it simple for trainees and instructor to hop in and out, meaning that this is a popular design classic that's endured.</p>

            <h4>Deliveries: 10,877</h4>
            <p>The first 737 was rolled out on January 17, 1967 and took to the skies for the first time three months later. It was christened by flight attendants from the 17 airlines that had placed orders for it. German flag carrier Lufthansa took delivery of the production version of the plane, known as the 737-100, later that year, marking the first time a new Boeing aircraft was launched by a European airline. United Airlines received its first 737 the following day, in a version stretched three feet to fit more seats -- and dubbed 737-200 -- that proved more popular.
            <br><br>
            Its main competitors at the time, the BAC-111 and the Douglas DC-9, also had two engines, but they were placed near the tail of the plane, making the back section of the cabin narrower and noisier. Boeing's designers placed the 737 engines under the wing instead, much like the company's other jets, which reduced noise and vibration and made maintenance easier, because they could be reached without a ladder. To add to these selling points, the 737 also had six seats per row versus the competitors' five, meaning it could carry more passengers.

            <h4>Deliveries: 10,176</h4>
            <p>The first A320 entered service in March 1988 and the twin-engine single-aisle craft has clocked up more than 280 million flight hours in the years since. Variants include the A318, A319 and A321, while the A320neo family was introduced into service in 2016.
            <br><br>
            Technically, The A320 has two variants, the A320-100, and the A320-200, but in fact, Only 21 A320-100s were ever produced. The main differences between the two variants are wingtip fences intended to minimize drag and increase wing efficiency and also the A320-200 features more fuel capacity.
            <br><br>
            The most renowned aspect of the aircraft is the adoption of fly-by-wire, which is a technology that was previously reserved for high-performance military jets and the supersonic Concorde. Another new technology used in the aircraft is flight envelope protection, which is a safety system designed to prevent the aircraft from flying beyond its performance capabilities.
            And one of the most useful innovations in this plane was that Airbus launched cockpit commonality for Airbus with this aircraft. Since the launch of A320, Airbus started to unify its cockpits designs to be similar in operation. That is why pilots to transition between different Airbus models with the same Type Rating.

            <h4>Deliveries: 1,945</h4>
            <p>Regional jets are smaller planes, usually with fewer than 100 seats, that are designed for short-haul routes. The Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet family is the best-selling of its kind.
            <br><br>
            Canadian manufacturer Bombardier launched the program with the 50-seat CRJ, which was certified in 1992, before expanding with the 70-seat CRJ700 in 1997, the 86-seat CRJ900 in 2000 and the 100-seat CRJ1000 in 2007.
            <br><br>
            The last of the popular short-hop jets was delivered to Utah-based SkyWest Airlines in February 2021.</p>

            <p>This mid-sized plane, with a T-shaped tail and three rear-mounted engines, had range for transoceanic flights but was also versatile enough to land on short runways at smaller airports.
            <br><br>
            Boeing's original plan was to build just 250 of the craft, but it would go on to be the first commercial airplane to reach the 1,000-sales milestone.
            <br><br>
            In one of aviation's greatest unsolved mysteries, in 1971 a man known as D.B. Cooper hijacked a 727 in the northwest United States before parachuting to the ground with $200,000 of stolen cash strapped to his body.
            <br><br>
            The audacious escape was only possible because an early design quirk of the 727 meant that the rear door could be opened mid-flight.</p>

            <p>The twin-engined "Triple Seven" isn't as humungous as the Queen of the Skies, but at nearly 64 meters in length the long-range wide-body is still longer than seven telephone poles laid end to end and can accommodate 440 passengers.
            <br><br>
            It was the first jetliner to be wholly designed by computer and the first Boeing aircraft to have weight-saving, computer-operated "fly-by-wire" controls.
            <br><br>
            It's now a growing family of eight variants, with the extra-large 777X aircraft -- the 777-8 and 777-9 -- the newest additions. The much-delayed 777X-9 is projected to enter service in 2024 while production of the 777X-8 has yet to begin.

            <h4>Deliveries so far: 1,527</h4>
            <p>Affectionately known as "Queen of the Skies," the four-engine 747 was the first wide-body plane and the original "jumbo jet."
            <br><br>
            It entered service in 1970 with legendary airline Pan Am and soon became synonymous with the glamorous age of international travel. Since 1990, it's been the US presidential choice, with the Air Force One fleet comprising two customized 747-200Bs.
            <br><br>
            In recent years, many airlines have been replacing their passenger 747s with bigger, more efficient twin-engine planes.</p>

            <p>The wide-body A330 went into service 28 years ago this month, and was conceived by its European manufacturer Airbus as a successor to the A300 -- the world's first twin-engine wide-body plane.
            <br><br>
            The 63.66-meter long A330-300 was the first variant, with capacity for up to 440 passengers, and a versatility that meant it was suitable for both short-haul trips and long-range distances of up to 6,350 nautical miles.
            <br><br>
            It was followed by the smaller-scale A330-200, and then later the two "neo" craft, the A330-800 and A339-900, both with revolutionary curved wingtips.</p>
