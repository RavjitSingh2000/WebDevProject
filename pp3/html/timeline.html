            <p>For thousands of years, humans have dreamed of taking to the skies. The quest has led from kite flying in ancient China to hydrogen-powered hot-air balloons in 18th-century France to contemporary aircraft so sophisticated they can’t be detected by radar or the human eye.
            <br><br>
            Below is a timeline of humans’ obsession with flight, from da Vinci to drones. Fasten your seatbelt and prepare for liftoff.</p>

                <p>Few figures in history had more detailed ideas, theories and imaginings on aviation as the Italian artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci. His book Codex on the Flight of Birds contained thousands of notes and hundreds of sketches on the nature of flight and aerodynamic principles that would lay much of the early groundwork for—and greatly influence—the development of aviation and manmade aircraft.</p>

                <p>Two months after French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier engineered a successful test flight with a duck, a sheep and a rooster as passengers, two humans ascended in a Montgolfier-designed balloon over Paris. Powered by a hand-fed fire, the paper-and-silk aircraft rose 500 vertical feet and traveled some 5.5 miles over about half an hour. But in an 18th-century version of the space race, rival balloon engineers Jacques Alexander Charles and Nicholas Louis Robert upped the ante just 10 days later. Their balloon, powered by hydrogen gas, traveled 25 miles and stayed aloft more than two hours.

            <div class="div2">
                <p>At the dawn of the 19th century, English philosopher George Cayley published “On Aerial Navigation,” a radical series of papers credited with introducing the world to the study of aerodynamics. By that time, the man who came to be known as “the father of aviation” had already been the first to identify the four forces of flight (weight, lift, drag, thrust), developed the first concept of a fixed-wing flying machine and designed the first glider reported to have carried a human aloft.</p>

            <div class="div2">
                <p>Half a century before the Wright brothers took to the skies, French engineer Henri Giffard manned the first-ever powered and controllable airborne flight. Giffard, who invented the steam injector, traveled almost 17 miles from Paris to Élancourt in his “Giffard Dirigible,” a 143-foot-long, cigar-shaped airship loosely steered by a three-bladed propeller that was powered by a 250-pound, 3-horsepower engine, itself lit by a 100-pound boiler. The flight proved that a steam-powered airship could be steered and controlled.</p>

In addition to revolutionizing automobile travel, the innovation ushered in a new era of longer, more controlled aviation.

                <p>Flying from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first controlled, sustained flight of a heavier-than-air aircraft. Each brother flew their wooden, gasoline-powered propeller biplane, the “Wright Flyer,” twice (four flights total), with the shortest lasting 12 seconds and the longest sustaining flight for about 59 seconds. Considered a historic event today, the feat was largely ignored by newspapers of the time, who believed the flights were too short to be important.

                <p>French engineer and bicycle maker Paul Cornu became the first man to ride a rotary-wing, vertical-lift aircraft, a precursor to today’s helicopter, when he was lifted about 1.5 meters off the ground for 20 seconds near Lisieux, France. Versions of the helicopter had been toyed with in the past—Italian engineer Enrico Forlanini debuted the first rotorcraft three decades prior in 1877. And it would be improved upon in the future, with American designer Igor Sikorsky introducing a more standardized version in Stratford, Connecticut in 1939. But it was Cornu’s short flight that would land him in the history books as the definitive first.</p>

                According to The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Military Aircraft, France was the war’s leading aircraft manufacturer, producing nearly 68,000 planes between 1914 and 1918. Of those, nearly 53,000 were shot down, crashed or damaged.</p>

Their perilous 16-hour journey, undertaken eight years before Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic alone, started in St. John's, Newfoundland, where they barely cleared the trees at the end of the runway. After a calamity-filled flight, they crash-landed in a peat bog in County Galway, Ireland; remarkably, neither man was injured.</p>

The promise of the steam-powered, hydrogen-filled airships quickly evaporated, however, after the infamous 1937 Hindenburg disaster. That’s when the gas inside the Zeppelin company’s flagship Hindenburg vessel exploded during a landing attempt, killing 35 passengers and crew members and badly burning the majority of the 62 remaining survivors.</p>

But when the British-manufactured de Havilland Comet took its first flight in 1949—boasting four turbine engines, a pressurized cabin, large windows and a relatively comfortable seating area—it marked a pivotal step in modern commercial air travel. An early, flawed design however, caused the de Havilland to be grounded after a series of mid-flight disasters—but not before giving the world a glimpse of what was possible.</p>

Pan American Airways became the first commercial carrier to take delivery of the elongated, swept-wing planes, launching daily flights from New York to Paris. The 707 quickly became a symbol of postwar modernity—a time when air travel would become commonplace, people dressed up to fly and flight attendants reflected the epitome of chic. The plane even inspired Frank Sinatra’s hit song “Come Fly With Me.”</p>

The collision occurred when the KLM jet, trying to navigate a runway shrouded in fog, initiated its takeoff run while the Pan Am jetliner was still on the runway. All aboard the KLM flight and most on the Pan Am flight were killed. Tragically, neither plane was scheduled to fly from that airport on that day, but a small bomb set off at a nearby airport caused them both to be diverted to Los Rodeos.</p>

                <p>The year <strong>1903</strong> marks one of the most innovative historical moments of aviation when the American aviation pioneers <strong>Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright</strong> made the first successful powered, sustained, controlled heavier-than-air aircraft flight. Although the traces of the existence of aircraft can be found in ancient history millenniums back, it was Wright Brothers who built and flew the first fully practical airplane on December 17, 1903.

                <p>Airlines form a significant portion of aviation, and the world’s first carrier that came into revenue operation is <strong>DELAG of Germany</strong>. Founded on November 16, 1909, DELAG became the foremost airline to operate an aircraft in revenue service. Every year several airlines come and disappear from the aviation landscape, but the longest-standing airlines in the world are <strong> KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (estd. 1919), SCATDTA (1919), Qantas Airways (1920), Aeroflot-Russian Airlines (19230, Czech Airlines (1923), Finnair (1923), Tajik Air (1924), Delta Air Lines (1925),</strong> etc.</p>

                <p>Just as flying animals, airplane designs are constantly evolving over time. Each aircraft model is different and possesses its own set of specific capabilities and features. Since the modern pioneer flight in 1903, aircraft designs have come a long way, and they are becoming more reliable, powerful, and efficient than ever. Aviation is at the forefront of technological advancements, with various airplane models coming over time, from jumbo jets to light passenger planes, cargo planes, military jets, strategic reconnaissance surveillance aircraft, etc.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Another interesting fact about aviation is that there are a handful of fighter jets that have lightning-fast speed and can disappear in a blink of an eye. Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, which outruns a missile, MiG-31 Foxhound cruising at the supersonic speed of over 2.8, and Mach 3+Lockheed YF-12 are some of the fastest fighter jets in the world. In commercial operations, Concorde is the fastest passenger jet, with a top speed of 1,354 mph.</p>
